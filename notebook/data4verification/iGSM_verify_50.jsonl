{"index": 48, "question": "The number of each Y0's X6 equals 22. The number of each X6's W8 equals each Y0's X6. How many WWW does each X6 have?", "answer": 22, "seed": 10, "gt_cot": "Define each Y0's X6 as s. So s = 22.\nDefine each X6's W8 as A. So A = s = 22.\nDefine each X6's WWW as d. So d = A = 22.\nThus, the answer is 22."}
{"index": 49, "question": "The number of each Y6's X1 equals 5. How many XXX does each Y6 have?", "answer": 5, "seed": 10, "gt_cot": "Define each Y6's X1 as L. So L = 5.\nDefine each Y6's XXX as t. So t = L = 5.\nThus, the answer is 5."}
{"index": 50, "question": "The number of each Y0's X8 equals 0 times each Y2's WWW. The number of each Y4's X4 equals 2 more than each X5's W9. The number of each Y2's X4 equals 16 more than each X4's WWW. The number of each X4's W5 equals 20. The number of each X5's W9 equals each Y0's X8. The number of each X7's W2 equals the difference of each Y4's X4 and each Z7's WWW. The number of each Z7's Y4 equals the difference of each X4's WWW and each Y4's X4. How many W2 does each X7 have?", "answer": 18, "seed": 10, "gt_cot": "Define each X4's W5 as a. So a = 20.\nDefine each X4's WWW as r. So r = a = 20.\nDefine each Y2's X4 as k. So k = 16 + r = 16 + 20 = 13.\nDefine each Y2's WWW as w. So w = k * r = 13 * 20 = 7.\nDefine each Y0's X8 as F. So F = 0 * w = 0 * 7 = 0.\nDefine each X5's W9 as p. So p = F = 0.\nDefine each Y4's X4 as n. So n = 2 + p = 2 + 0 = 2.\nDefine each Y4's WWW as s. So s = n * r = 2 * 20 = 17.\nDefine each Z7's Y4 as W. So W = r - n = 20 - 2 = 18.\nDefine each Z7's WWW as m. So m = W * s = 18 * 17 = 7.\nDefine each X7's W2 as j. So j = n - m = 2 - 7 = 18.\nThus, the answer is 18."}
